Hello! I'm Min-Geun Park, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Mechatronics and Control Systems, from the [Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics Research Laboratory (AIMRL)](https://aimrl.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to this, I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the same institution.

During my studies, my research interests have revolved around nonlinear control theory, controller design, and mechatronics. I actively participated in a project focusing on the [Magnetic Leadscrew (ML)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=aZCe2VQAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=aZCe2VQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC), under the guidance of [Prof. Kok-Meng Lee](https://aimrl.gatech.edu/kmlee.html) and mentorship of Wenjing Li. Now, I'm eager to expand my research horizons into domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, and wearable technology.

Beyond academia, I find joy in developing mobile applications, as well as indulging in activities like surfing and snowboarding.

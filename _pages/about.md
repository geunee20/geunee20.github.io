Hello! My name is Min-Geun Park, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mechatronics and Control Systems at the [Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics Research Laboratory (AIMRL)](https://aimrl.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I also completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.

My research interests are centered around nonlinear control theory, controller design, and mechatronics. I am actively involved in a project focusing on the [Magnetic Leadscrew (ML)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10202569), guided by [Prof. Kok-Meng Lee](https://aimrl.gatech.edu/kmlee.html) and mentored by [Wenjing Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenjing-li-48830616a/). I am looking to broaden my research into areas such as robotics, autonomous systems, and wearable technology and am seeking a Ph.D. position to explore these interdisciplinary fields further.

Outside of academics, I enjoy developing mobile applications, surfing, and snowboarding.

### Atlanta Science Festival

<a id="atlanta-science-festival"></a>

_March 2024_

I was a volunteering staff at the [Atlanta Science Festival](https://research.gatech.edu/ATLScienceFestival). I prepared approximately 300 demo materials for the big weekend event. On the event day, at the DIY Robotic Hand Booth, I demonstrated how to build cardboard hands and showcased a real robotic hand for children to see and interact with.

### SKKU Global Mentoring and Assisting People

<a id="SG-Maple"></a>

_December 2015 - December 2016_

As a [Student Buddy](https://webzine-skku-edu.translate.goog/skkuzine/section/coverStory.do?mode=list&articleNo=34199&_x_tr_sl=ko&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), I organized and led diverse cultural exchange programs in Korea, including hiking excursions, participation in the World Food Festival, Seoul Tour Marathon, and visits to the Korean Folk Village. These initiatives not only facilitated cultural adaptation and integration for international students but also significantly enriched my appreciation of diverse cultures. Engaging with students from various backgrounds during these activities, I felt a profound sense of accomplishment and connection as we shared experiences and learned from each other. This role enhanced cross-cultural understanding and fostered a supportive international community, leaving me with lasting impressions of joy and mutual respect.

### Rural Education Support Initiative

<a id="rural-education"></a>

_May 2015 - August 2016_

During my military service, I volunteered as a math tutor at [Yulmyeon High School](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BZrqtW3GoZsguiPb7), teaching Algebra and Pre-Calculus to students in a rural area with limited resources. I served through the Rural Education Support Initiative, developing a tailored curriculum and individualized learning strategies that focused on enhancing mathematical understanding and problem-solving skills. Beyond traditional teaching, I utilized visual aids to clarify abstract concepts and organized interactive group activities to promote a collaborative learning environment. One notable example was adapting lessons for a student from an isolated rural area who struggled with basic geometry. By using examples from his daily life, such as farm layouts to explain area and perimeter, I not only improved his understanding but also ignited his interest in math's practical applications. This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and innovation in addressing students' unique educational needs.

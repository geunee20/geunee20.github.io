Introduction</h1> <p>On Day 4, I realized that while a PID controller with gravity compensation stabilizes the system faster, it often struggles with overreactions and potential destabilizations. This occurs because it focuses solely on angular positions, neglecting angular velocities.</p> <p>Building on the equations of motion derived on Day 3 for the triple-link mechanism:</p> \[\tau = M(q)\ddot{q} + h(q, \dot{q}) + g(q) \tag{1}\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Matrix M (Inertial Term)</strong>: Reflects the Newtonian response to applied forces, considering the inertia of the masses.</li> <li><strong>Matrix h (Coriolis and Centrifugal Forces)</strong>: Accounts for forces due to system velocities and rotational dynamics.</li> <li><strong>Matrix g (Gravitational Term)</strong>: Represents the gravitational forces acting on each segment.</li> </ul> <p>Today, I introduce a nonlinear control system that combines a PID controller with the computed torque method. This system tackles the nonlinear dynamics effectively, compensating for gravity and dynamic forces while integrating displacement and velocity feedback. This approach, known as feedback linearization, linearizes the control by canceling out nonlinearities, enhancing system stability and tracking accuracy.</p> <p>The updated methodology reduces the need for extensive parameter tuning and improves response times, making the system more reliable and user-friendly. It is particularly suited for advanced robotics and precision engineering applications where accuracy and dynamic performance are crucial.</p> <p>The revised block diagrams in Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how the computed torque method enhances the PID controller by leveraging the system’s full dynamics to accurately predict and correct disturbances. These diagrams are referenced from Dr. Jun Ueda’s lecture slides.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Linearized Dynamics:</strong> The linearized system dynamics are introduced using the equation:</p> \[\tau = M(q)\ddot{q}' + h(q, \dot{q}) + g(q) \tag{2}\] <p>This formula for \(\tau\), based on the computed input \(\ddot{q}'\), quantifies the total force required to achieve the control objectives. The dynamics without control input adjustment, given by Equation 1, are aligned with this formulation to yield:</p> \[M(q)\ddot{q}' + h(q, \dot{q}) + g(q) = M(q)\ddot{q} + h(q, \dot{q}) + g(q) \Rightarrow \ddot{q}' = \ddot{q} \tag{3}\] <p>This result indicates that under ideal control conditions, where the system accurately follows the control input, \(\ddot{q}'\) aligns with the actual acceleration \(\ddot{q}\) needed to match the desired trajectory, thereby confirming that the new control input effectively compensates for all dynamic forces impacting the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Input Through PID Controller:</strong> The new input \(\ddot{q}'\) is formulated using a PID controller to correct the error, described by the equation:</p> \[\ddot{q}' = \ddot{q}_d + K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}) + K_p(q_d - q) + K_i\int{(q_d - q)}dt \tag{4}\] <p>Using Equations 3 and 4, the dynamics correction can be expressed as:</p> \[(\ddot{q}_d - \ddot{q}) + K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}) + K_p(q_d - q) + K_i\int{(q_d - q)}dt \tag{5}\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Define the Error Dynamics:</strong> The tracking error is foundational for deriving the system’s dynamics, defined by:</p> \[e = q_d - q \tag{6}\] <p>This definition facilitates the expression of derivatives in terms of error:</p> \[\dot{e} = \dot{q}_d - \dot{q}, \quad \ddot{e} = \ddot{q}_d - \ddot{q} \tag{7}\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Error Dynamics Equation:</strong> Derived from Equation 5 by substituting Equations 6 and 7, the full error dynamics is given by:</p> \[\ddot{e} + K_d\dot{e} + K_pe + K_i \int{e}dt = 0 \tag{9}\] <p>This equation establishes the control dynamics under the implemented inputs, serving as a crucial indicator for system stability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stability Analysis:</strong> The stability of the system is evaluated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routh%E2%80%93Hurwitz_stability_criterion">Routh–Hurwitz criterion</a>, which is a well-established method for determining the stability of linear control systems. According to this criterion, the system is considered stable if:</p> \[K_dK_p &gt; K_i \tag{8}\] <p>This inequality must hold to ensure that the system approaches stability, meaning that as time approaches infinity, the error effectively reduces to zero:</p> \[t \rightarrow \infty \Rightarrow e \rightarrow 0.\] </li> </ol> <h1 id="ii-modeling">II. Modeling</h1> <h3 id="1-overall-system">1. Overall System</h3> <p>The overall system is illustrated in Figure 3. As observed, the system architecture bears resemblance to a traditional PID control setup but incorporates additional subsystems and components to enhance functionality. These new elements are the “MUX (Red box)” and “DEMUX (Blue box)”, which play critical roles in handling signal matrices within the control loop.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>MUX (Red box)</strong>: The Multiplexer (MUX) is used to combine multiple single signals into a single matrix. This is particularly useful in control systems like ours where multiple input signals need to be processed simultaneously in a compact form. In Simulink, a MUX block simplifies system connections by aggregating several input lines into one output, feeding into systems that require a single input stream containing multiple signals.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>DEMUX (Blue box)</strong>: Conversely, the Demultiplexer (DEMUX) is used to split a matrix into its component single signals. This is essential for systems that process signals in a matrix form but then require individual signal handling downstream. In Simulink, the DEMUX block facilitates the distribution of a single input containing multiple data points into multiple outputs, which can then be directed to specific parts of the system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By channeling matrices through a “Computed Torque” subsystem using these blocks, the system is able to compute and output a new feedback torque that is more accurately aligned with the dynamic requirements of the controlled process.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/03_overall_system-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/03_overall_system-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/03_overall_system-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/03_overall_system.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 3. Schematic of the Multi-Link Mechanism Control System. </div> <h3 id="2-computed-torque-method-block">2. Computed Torque Method Block</h3> <p>Calculating torque through circuit design can be complex and time-consuming. Similar to the gravity calculation block described on Day 4, the computed torque method block simplifies this process. As depicted in Figure 4 and detailed through MATLAB scripts in Figures 5-7, I utilize “MATLAB Function blocks” within the computed torque block. These blocks allow me to script MATLAB code directly to compute each term of Equation 1. It’s important to note that I used a Matrix multiplication block instead of an element-wise multiplication block because Equation 1 involves matrix calculations, necessitating proper alignment and dimension matching of matrices.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>\(M(q)\)</strong>: This block computes the mass matrix (M) from Equation 1, which is critical as it reflects the system’s inertia. The matrix \(M\) is derived by partially differentiating Equation 1 with respect to each angular acceleration.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>\(h(q, \dot{q})\)</strong>: This block calculates the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, represented as the second term in Equation 1. These dynamic forces are crucial for accurately modeling the behavior of rotating systems. The matrix \(h\) is obtained by isolating these forces in Equation 1, which can be done by subtracting \(M(q)\ddot{q} + g(q)\) from the total torque \(\tau\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>\(g(q)\)</strong>: This block computes the gravitational forces, consistent with the gravity block used on Day 4. This ensures that gravitational effects are accurately integrated into the torque computation. The matrix \(g\) is derived by isolating the gravitational term in Equation 1, which involves differentiating the gravitational components and then reintegrating them into the model.</p> </li> </ul> <div style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/04_computed_torque_method-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/04_computed_torque_method-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/04_computed_torque_method-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-06-03-Controller-Design-Day-5/04_computed_torque_method.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 4.

Simulation</h1> <p>In this section, I explore the simulation, focusing on both tracking and regulation capabilities of the multi-link mechanism control system.

Tracking</h3> <h5 id="a-no-pid-input">a) No PID Input</h5> <p>Initially, I set all the gains of the PID controller to zero to evaluate whether the computed torque block alone could effectively track the reference input. The results indicated that without the PID gains, the system failed to track the reference input and could not stabilize. I extended the simulation to 10,000 seconds, but the system remained unstable throughout, exhibiting behavior akin to an upside-down, slowly oscillating triple-link mechanism, which also showed signs of chaotic dynamics. This instability likely stems from the absence of error correction typically provided by the PID controller.

Moving Forward</h1> <p>Today, I enhanced the control of a fully actuated multi-link mechanism using a PID controller integrated with the computed torque method. Compared to standalone PID control and PID with gravity compensation, this approach demonstrated superior performance. One notable advantage is that this system achieves full linearity through feedback linearization, simplifying the control loop.</p> <p>During the simulation, I observed two key findings: First, while the gains of the PID controller can be increased significantly, this does not necessarily translate to improved performance. Second, although the computed torque method markedly enhances system performance, it does not address inherent PID limitations such as the potential for overreaction. This suggests that while the PID controller remains a component, some of its fundamental drawbacks persist.</p> <p>Through Days 4 and 5, I studied and implemented the feedback linearization method for nonlinear systems. Now, equipped with this understanding, I am eager to explore a variety of other nonlinear control strategies.

However, this simplicity can also be a drawback. The system may overreact or destabilize because it does not account for complex dynamics. Additionally, PID controllers often struggle with balancing between faster response and overshoot, and designing an effective system can be challenging due to its inherent limitations in handling nonlinear behaviors.</p> <p>Today, I will introduce the first nonlinear control system that combines a PID controller with gravity compensation method. This approach offers a straightforward yet effective framework for managing a triple-link mechanism, enhancing the simplicity of implementation. By integrating gravity compensation method, this system improves upon traditional PID controllers, specifically addressing the nonlinearities induced by gravitational forces and reducing the settling time.</p> <p>On Day 3, I derived the equations of motion for the triple-link mechanism:</p> \[\tau = M(q)\ddot{q} + h(q, \dot{q}) + g(q)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Matrix M (Inertial Term)</strong>: Represents the Newtonian response of the system to applied forces, accounting for the inertia of the masses.</li> <li><strong>Matrix h (Coriolis and Centrifugal Forces)</strong>: Quantifies the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, dependent on system velocities and rotational dynamics.</li> <li><strong>Matrix g (Gravitational Term)</strong>: Accounts for the force due to gravity acting on each mass component.</li> </ul> <p>To compensate for gravity, I extract the \(g\) matrix from the equation of motion and add it to the feedback from the PID controller.

Through these simulations, I aim to validate the effectiveness of the controllers in maintaining trajectory accuracy (tracking) and stabilizing the system against disturbances (regulation).</p> <h5 id="1-tracking">1) Tracking</h5> <p>Firstly, I set all the gains of the PID controller to zero to test if compensating gravity alone could track the reference input. The results demonstrated that it could neither track the reference input nor stabilize the system. I ran the simulation for up to 10,000 seconds, but the system remained unstable. It resembled an upside-down, slow-moving triple-link mechanism, which also exhibited chaotic behavior. The simulation video and the graph for each joint parameter are displayed in Video 1 and Figure 5, respectively.</p> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/posts/2024-05-28-Controller-Design-Day-4/01_fixed_no_PID.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls="" muted=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Video 1.

Additionally, systems with gravity compensation restabilized more quickly and exhibited smaller overshoots compared to those without it under similar conditions when dealing with small disturbances. However, for larger disturbances, does gravity compensation resolve issues such as overreaction and destabilization? The answer is no. Despite implementing gravity compensation, these issues remained unresolved for larger disturbances.

The simulations revealed that gravity compensation significantly enhances stabilization by maintaining a high angular velocity when the angular displacement is minimal.

Due to its simplistic mechanism, an in-depth understanding of the triple-link mechanism’s behavior was not required. However, given the inherent nonlinearity of the triple-link mechanism, the PID controller proved somewhat inefficient and performed less effectively compared to other controllers.</p> <p>Subsequent controllers necessitate a thorough analysis of the triple-link mechanism’s behavior. Therefore, I will explore the equations of motion and the Jacobians of the triple-link mechanism in detail.</p> <h1 id="i-background">I. Background</h1> <h3 id="a-lagrangian-dynamics">A. Lagrangian Dynamics</h3> <p>Newtonian dynamics typically employs rectangular (orthogonal) coordinate systems and incorporates constraint forces directly into the system. In contrast, Lagrangian dynamics is more flexible, allowing the use of any set of variables—known as generalized coordinates, denoted q—as long as they uniquely describe the position of the bodies within the system. The general formulation of Lagrangian dynamics is often derived from Hamilton’s principle, but it can also be developed through Newtonian principles. This approach uses the relationship between work and force to formulate the equations of motion in terms of the desired coordinates within the system. Importantly, it is possible to initiate an analysis using Lagrangian dynamics without first employing other dynamical formulations.</p> <h3 id="b-derivation-of-dynamics-equations-of-motion">B. Derivation of Dynamics Equations of Motion</h3> <p>Lagrangian dynamics centers around the use of the Lagrangian, defined as:</p> \[L = KE - PE \tag{1}\] <p>Here, \(KE\) represents the total kinetic energy of the system, and \(PE\) PE denotes the total potential energy, both expressed in terms of generalized coordinates (e.g., \(x, \theta_1\)). This equation is manipulated to derive the equations of motion for the system through the following relationship:</p> \[\left(\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}\right)^T = Q \tag{2}\] <p>In this equation, \(Q\) is a vector that includes each of the generalized forces associated with the chosen generalized coordinates (e.g., \(f_x, \tau_1\)).</p> <p>Let the following is the equation of motion of a double-link mechanism.</p> \[\begin{bmatrix}\tau_1 \\ \tau_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} M_{1, 1} &amp; M_{1, 2} \\ M_{2, 1} &amp; M_{2, 2} \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\ddot{\theta}_1 \\ \ddot{\theta}_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} h_{1, 1}\dot{\theta}_2^2 + h_{1, 2}\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2 \\ h_{2, 1}\dot{\theta}_1^2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} g_{1} \\ g_{2}\end{bmatrix}g\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Matrix M (Inertial Term)</strong>: Represents the Newtonian response of the system to applied forces, accounting for the inertia of the masses.</li> <li><strong>Matrix h (Coriolis and Centrifugal Forces)</strong>: <ul> <li><strong>Centrifugal Force</strong>: Arises from terms like \(\dot{\theta}_1^2, \dot{\theta}_2^2\) and affects the system when rotating.</li> <li><strong>Coriolis Force</strong>: Results from terms like \(\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2\) and is evident when components of the system move relative to one another.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Matrix g (Gravitational Term)</strong>: Accounts for the force due to gravity acting on each mass component.</li> </ul> <h3 id="c-derivation-of-jacobians">C. Derivation of Jacobians</h3> <p>The Jacobian matrix is a fundamental tool in linear approximation, playing a crucial role in understanding how small changes in input variables affect output variables. It is especially valuable for analyzing system behavior near a specific operational point.</p> <p>Suppose you have a function \(f\) that maps a set of inputs \(\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2, ..., q_n)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to outputs \(\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_m)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\):</p> \[\mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\] <p>where</p> \[\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{q}) = \begin{bmatrix} p_1(q_1, \dots, q_n) \\ p_2(q_1, \dots, q_n) \\ \vdots \\ p_m(q_1, \dots, q_n) \end{bmatrix}\] <p>The Jacobian matrix \(\mathbf{J}\) of the function \(\mathbf{f}\) at a point \(\mathbf{q}\) in its domain is given by the matrix of partial derivatives:</p> \[\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial p_1}{\partial q_1} &amp; \frac{\partial p_1}{\partial q_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial p_1}{\partial q_n} \\ \frac{\partial p_2}{\partial q_1} &amp; \frac{\partial p_2}{\partial q_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial p_2}{\partial q_n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial p_m}{\partial q_1} &amp; \frac{\partial p_m}{\partial q_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial p_m}{\partial q_n} \end{bmatrix} \tag{3}\] <p>In our scenario, the Jacobian matrix captures the relationship between each joint parameter and the position and orientation of link3’s center of mass, since our system does not include a typical end-effector.</p> <h1 id="ii-our-scenario">II.

This setup is typical in industrial robots and other motor-driven mechanisms, where each joint or axis is controlled by its own motor, facilitating precise manipulation.</p> <p>For example, a fully actuated multi-link mechanism is easier to control because each degree of freedom—whether it involves rotation or translation—is directly managed by an independent actuator. This direct manipulation allows for precise adjustments to the multi-link mechanism’s position and motion, simplifying the control algorithms needed for maintaining stability and achieving desired behaviors. In such systems, the control can often be accomplished using linear controllers, though an understanding of nonlinear dynamics is still beneficial for optimizing performance and handling more complex scenarios.</p> <p>Today, I will simulate the PID controller, which is the simplest and most representative type of linear controller.

These changes echo the foundational setups from Day 1 but with key differences:</p> <ul> <li>To better realize the oscillatory nature of real-world multi-link mechanism dynamics, I’ve configured the angular displacement of each link to be periodic, spanning a full circle from \(-\pi\) to \(\pi\).</li> <li>In a shift from the initial configuration, I’ve realigned the x-axis of link 1 to coincide with the z-axis of the world frame.</li> <li>Additionally, I’ve incorporated blocks to generate an impulsive external force at the end of link 3, to simulate external forces on the system and test its regulatory response.</li> </ul> <p>The modifications ensure that when the multi-link mechanism is upright, its angular displacement is set to \(0\). This allows us to use the origin as our equilibrium point in subsequent simulations.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/02_subsystem_link1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/02_subsystem_link1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/02_subsystem_link1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/02_subsystem_link1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 2: Detailed View of Link 1 Subsystem. </div> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/03_subsystem_link2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/03_subsystem_link2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/03_subsystem_link2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/03_subsystem_link2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 3: Detailed View of Link 2 Subsystem. </div> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/04_subsystem_link3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/04_subsystem_link3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/04_subsystem_link3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/04_subsystem_link3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 4: Detailed View of Link 3 Subsystem. </div> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> </div> <h5 id="2-pid-controller">2) PID Controller</h5> <p>Figure 5 shows a PID controller subsystem.

Meanwhile, Figures 6 through 9 analyze the angular displacement under various disturbances. Specifically, Videos 6 and 7, along with Figures 11 and 12, showcase a simulation of a triple-link mechanism subjected to a substantial disturbance, significant enough to potentially cause a single rotation. However, in these demonstrations, the multi-link mechanism rotates almost twice. Similarly, As demonstrated in Video 8 and Figure 13, the system exhibits prolonged regulation times when subjected to a strong disturbance. I suspect this excessive rotation is due to the control system not accounting for the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the multi-link mechanism. This oversight in the control strategy leads to an over-response to the disturbance. I am uncertain whether this issue can be addressed by tuning the PID controller or changing system parameters.

This instability is likely because, similar to the fixed base scenario, the PID controller primarily considers angular displacement, which may not suffice under more challenging conditions.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/13_moving_regulation_1.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls="" muted=""/> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/14_moving_regulation_2.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls="" muted=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/15_moving_regulation_3.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls="" muted=""/> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/posts/2024-05-20-Controller-Design-Day-2/16_moving_regulation_4.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls="" muted=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Videos 13 - 16.

My objective for Day 1 was to construct the foundational multibody system using Simscape, which involved creating multi-link mechanism with varying numbers of links. The challenge here is not just about assembling a physical model, but also simulating how these systems behave under different conditions—a crucial aspect for anyone venturing into the world of advanced robotics and control systems.</p> <h1 id="i-a-multi-link-mechanism-with-a-fixed-base">I. A Multi-Link Mechanism with a Fixed Base</h1> <h3 id="a-overall-system">A. Overall System</h3> <p>The process began with setting up the basic structure of the multi-link mechanism with a fixed base. I designed a schematic that includes components like the links and the fixed base that manage the multi-link mechanism’s movement (See Figure 1). This visual setup helps in understanding how each part interacts within the system and serves as a good starting point for simulation.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-15-Controller-Design-Day-1/01_overall_system_fixed-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-15-Controller-Design-Day-1/01_overall_system_fixed-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2024-05-15-Controller-Design-Day-1/01_overall_system_fixed-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2024-05-15-Controller-Design-Day-1/01_overall_system_fixed.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1.

This stage is crucial as it sets the groundwork for all subsequent experiments. I am designing multi-link mechanisms with varying numbers of links, each introducing unique challenges and dynamics. By setting up the initial simulation environment and examining how the system behaves under different initial conditions, I aim to gather a robust understanding of the fundamental dynamics that govern these intriguing mechanical structures.</p> <h4 id="phase-1-building-the-foundation">Phase 1: Building the Foundation</h4> <p>The first phase involves building a multibody system for the multi-link mechanism. This foundational step includes designing multi-link mechanisms with different numbers of links and setting up the initial simulation environment. By understanding the basic dynamics and how the system responds under various initial conditions, we can prepare for more complex control implementations.</p> <h4 id="phase-2-achieving-stability-with-pid-control">Phase 2: Achieving Stability with PID Control</h4> <p>Once the basic system is up and running, the focus shifts to implementing a PID controller for a multi-link mechanism with a fixed base. The application of the PID controller to the first joint (Joint 1) of the multi-link mechanism is a critical step towards achieving stable, controlled motion. Fine-tuning the PID parameters to maintain the multi-link mechanism in an upright position, despite potential disturbances, will be a test of precision and patience. This phase is pivotal as it lays the foundation for more dynamic challenges ahead.</p> <h4 id="phase-3-dynamic-adaptation-with-a-moving-base">Phase 3: Dynamic Adaptation with a Moving Base</h4> <p>Building on the stability achieved, I will then transition to experimenting with a moving base for the multi-link mechanism, which introduces a new layer of complexity. The previously static base now becomes dynamic, adding unpredictable elements to the control scenario. The challenge here is to adapt the PID controller to effectively manage these new dynamics, focusing on controlling the entire system holistically without direct actuation at Joint 1. This stage promises to be a rich ground for learning and innovation.</p> <h4 id="phase-4-advanced-control-with-lqr">Phase 4: Advanced Control with LQR</h4> <p>In this penultimate phase of our project, we delve into the application of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to control the moving base multi-link mechanism. The LQR method, a cornerstone in control theory, is celebrated for its ability to provide optimal control by minimizing a cost function that balances state errors and control effort. This powerful technique offers a robust solution for managing complex dynamic systems, making it an ideal candidate for our multi-link mechanism control challenge.</p> <h4 id="phase-5-advanced-control-with-reinforcement-learning">Phase 5: Advanced Control with Reinforcement Learning</h4> <p>The final frontier of this project will be the implementation of a reinforcement learning-based controller. This advanced phase will handle a moving base multi-link mechanism, still without any direct actuation at Joint 1. The objective is to enable the system to autonomously learn optimal control policies through continuous trial and error. This approach is expected to refine the system’s adaptability and optimize performance, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with intelligent control systems.</p> <p><br/> <br/></p> <p>Each phase of this project is designed to not only build on the previous experiences but also to introduce and overcome new complexities. This systematic escalation ensures a thorough exploration and understanding of each control strategy implemented.</p> <p>I invite you to stay tuned as I document this exciting journey, sharing detailed insights and results from each phase of my exploration into the dynamic realm of multi-link mechanisms. This blog will serve as a chronicle of my learning, challenges, breakthroughs, and, ultimately, the evolution of my understanding of control dynamics.
